	<p>
	 The e-Comments extension uses Google Sign-In and Google Drive purely for the purpose of allowing the user to save and sync comment data between devices that they are logged into. Only the user themselves has access to this data, except for comment data which they themselves choose to share. This extension does not transmit or store data on any device other than the user's personal devices and their Google Drive account, except for when the user chooses to post comments on a shared Google Doc file. This extension collects no personally identifiable data.
